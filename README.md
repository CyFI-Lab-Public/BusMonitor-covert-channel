## BusMonitor Memory Bus Covert Channel

I am not responsible for this code or its use. :P Please read the [BusMonitor](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.299.2497&rep=rep1&type=pdf) paper before working with this code.

Compile with gcc on Linux. I haven't tested other compilers/systems.

Like most proof-of-concept attacks, this code is highly system/processor dependent. I do not provide any support for using or modifying this code. Sorry.
